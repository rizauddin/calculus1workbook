\section{Related Rates}

\begin{myframe}[arc=10pt,auto outer arc]
	Find the rate at which some quantity is changing by relating the quantity to other quantities whose rates of change is known.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item Given $y = f(x)$ and $x = g(t)$ \\and a constant rate of change $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt}$.
		\item Find the changes of $y$ in time (or rate of change or how fast is the changing) when $x=`something'$.
		\item $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt} = \left. \frac{df}{dx} \right\vert_{x=`something'} \times \frac{dx}{dt}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{myframe}


\problemans{The value of $x$ is increasing at a constant rate of 4. How fast is $y = 3x^2 + 2$ changing at the instant $x=2$.}{$\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt} = 48$}

\problemans{The value of $y$ is decreasing at a constant rate of 1. $x^2 + y^2 = 625$. How fast is $x$ changing at the instant $x=7$.}{$\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{24}{7}$}
